    <h3> STEPS FOR PREPARING WAKE DA SHINKAFA</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Start by picking out any dirt or stones from the beans, then rinse them thoroughly. 
    Pour the beans into a pot, 
    add enough water, and bring them to a boil for about 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>
    Drain the water, rinse the beans again, 
    and add fresh water before cooking until they start to soften.</li> 
    
    <li>Wash the rice thoroughly to remove excess starch and set it aside. Once the beans are almost soft, 
    add the washed rice to the pot and stir. Pour in enough water to cover the mixture, then cover the 
    pot
    and allow it to cook on medium heat.</li>
    
    <li>Stir occasionally to prevent burning and ensure even cooking.  
    
    As the rice and beans soften, add salt to taste and continue cooking until the water is fully absorbed.
    
    Once done, remove from heat and serve with your preferred sauce, stew, or side dish.</li>
